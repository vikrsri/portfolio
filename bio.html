                <p class="proj-info" id="project1">My name is Vikram Srikishan and I am a junior at Northwestern studying Computer Science. I am from Princeton, New Jersey and I transferred to Northwestern from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute after my freshman year. After coming to Northwestern, I have found an interest in computer graphics - I have explored these interests through various courses such as Introduction to Computational Photography and Advanced Graphics Seminar. I am currently in the BS/MS program and I hope to complete a Master's thesis in the field of Computer Vision. I have interned at Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey as a Software Intern as well as the Ka Moamoa lab at Northwestern as a Research Intern. This upcoming summer I will be interning at Visa as a Software Engineering Intern, which I am extremely excited for!</p>
